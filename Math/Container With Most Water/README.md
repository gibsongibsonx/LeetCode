# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

### Solution:
```swift
class Solution {
    func maxArea(_ height: [Int]) -> Int {
        guard height.count > 2 else { return min(height[0], height[1]) }
        
        var area = 0, l = 0, r = height.count - 1
        while l < r {
            let lots = min(height[l],height[r]) * (r - l)
            area = max(area, lots)
            if height[l] < height[r] { l += 1 } else { r -= 1 }
        }
        return area
    }
}
```

### Description:

Given n non-negative integers ```a1, a2, ..., an```, where each represents a point at coordinate <code>(i, a<sub>i</sub>)</code>. n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line ```i``` is at <code>(i, a<sub>i</sub>)</code> and ```(i, 0)```. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

#### Example 1:

```swift
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

#### Example 2:
```swift
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

#### Example 3:
```swift
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
```

#### Example 4:
```swift
Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
```

#### Constraints:
```swift
n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104
```
